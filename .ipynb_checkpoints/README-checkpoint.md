# TikTok_Project

Our project analyzed a dataset of over 1,000 TikTok comments responding to a debate video posted by @smartypants that asked the classic question: “Is water wet?” The video features two presenters discussing whether wetness is an inherent property of water or whether it only applies when water covers another surface. Because the question depends on definitions and everyday reasoning, it generated a wide range of reactions that allowed us to explore how online audiences frame opinion-based arguments and how well an LLM can classify them.

Our research question focused on two goals. First, we wanted to understand how TikTok users expressed their stance in this debate. Second, we wanted to test whether an LLM could reliably categorize these comments after we developed clear conceptual definitions. We collected 1,000 comments and created two mutually exclusive coding categories: Concept 1 for comments that argue that water is wet and Concept 2 for comments that argue that water is not wet. Through multiple rounds of refinement, we clarified edge cases, added examples, and made our decision rules more precise so that both human coders and the LLM could apply the concepts consistently.

Our main findings showed that commenters were more likely to argue that water is not wet. Out of the clearly opinionated comments, about 55 supported the idea that water is wet, while about 118 argued against it. A large portion of the dataset consisted of neutral, humorous, or unrelated comments, which we coded as 0,0. Engagement patterns added further context. Neutral or humorous comments tended to receive the highest average number of likes, suggesting that the TikTok audience interacted with the video more for entertainment than for debate. Together, these results show that while explicit stances leaned toward “water is not wet,” the broader conversation was shaped by humor, distraction, and loosely structured reasoning. The project also demonstrated that with clear definitions, examples, and decision rules, an LLM can achieve strong inter-rater reliability when classifying short-form social media comments.
