    "### Description: \n",
    "> The TikTok video from the account @smartypants shows a short discussion centered around the well known question of whether water is wet. The video features two presenters standing behind a counter with a clear container of water placed in front of them. One presenter introduces the topic by raising the question directly, asking whether water itself can be classified as wet or if wetness is a property that only applies when a liquid comes into contact with another surface. The other presenter responds by examining the meaning of the word “wet” and how it is used in everyday language. He explains that people usually describe something as wet when a sufficient amount of water clings to or covers its surface. Based on this definition, he argues that water cannot be wet because wetness is a condition created by water acting on something else. The male presenter then challenges this view by suggesting that water molecules are constantly touching one another and therefore are always surrounded by other water molecules. He argues that if being coated in water is what makes something wet, then water itself should qualify because each particle of water is covered by more water. Their debate continues as they alternate between these two perspectives. They bring attention to the difference between a descriptive property that applies to objects, such as a towel or a table becoming wet, and the intrinsic physical identity of water as a liquid. The video frames these two explanations as competing interpretations that depend on how wetness is defined, which encourages viewers to form their own stance and contribute comments that support one side or the other. In doing so, the video creates a straightforward but conceptually interesting question that invites argument based on definitions, observable physical properties, and individual interpretations of language.\n",

    "We revised our concepts to increase clarity, mutual exclusivity, and coder agreement. Our original definitions (“supportive of the premise that water is wet” and “generally in disagreement with the premise that water is wet”) were too vague and required subjective interpretation. They did not specify what counts as evidence of support, how to label jokes or scientific explanations, or how to treat neutral or off-topic comments. The lecture emphasized that concepts must be defined so clearly that a young child could reliably code them, and our low original alpha scores indicated that our definitions were not operationalized enough to meet that standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "The revised definitions directly address this issue by adding explicit coding rules, making each concept dependent on clear linguistic markers, and establishing a consistent rule for handling ambiguous comments. These changes reduce guesswork, eliminate overlap between the two concepts, and ensure all coders treat edge cases in the same way. Now, both human and LM reliability increased."

    "## **Reflection on Changing Prompting Strategies For Better Inter-Rater Reliability Scores**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In the beginning of the project, our prompting strategy left too much room for interpretation, which made the model inconsistent and lowered our inter-rater reliability. A lot of comments in the dataset were unclear, sarcastic, or not taking a clear stance, and the model kept trying to infer meaning instead of following a strict standard. To improve this, we rewrote the prompt so the model had very clear rules to follow. The most important change was creating a firm guideline for when to assign 0,0 versus 0,1 or 1,0. We specified that a comment must explicitly choose one side of the water debate in order to receive 0,1 or 1,0. If the comment was ambiguous, humorous, meta, or off topic, it had to be coded as 0,0 every time. This single adjustment eliminated most of the inconsistent edge cases that were dragging down our reliability scores. We also refined the definitions of the two main concepts in the debate, clearly explaining what counts as “water is wet” reasoning and what counts as “water is not wet” reasoning. Giving the model sharper conceptual boundaries made its decisions far more consistent."

    "## **Results:**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis of the 1,000 TikTok comments showed that most users did not agree with the premise that water is wet. Out of the full dataset, about 55 comments clearly supported the idea that water is wet, while about 118 comments argued that water is not wet. This means that among commenters who took a definite position, the argument that water is not wet appeared more than twice as often. These comments generally relied on everyday explanations, such as the idea that wetness describes what happens when water coats another surface. Many commenters repeated versions of the claim that water cannot be wet because it is the substance that makes other things wet. This suggested that viewers tended to draw on intuitive language and familiar logic rather than scientific definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, a large portion of comments did not engage with the question in any meaningful way. Many users made jokes, tagged friends, reacted to the presenters, or shared unrelated thoughts. There were also many comments comparing the water debate to statements like “fire is hot but not burned,” which echoed the overall structure of the argument without actually taking a stance. Under our coding rules these comments were classified as 0,0, and they confirmed that the TikTok discussion often drifted away from the topic, especially when the prompt encouraged playful or definition based responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at engagement patterns added more context to these findings. Although the “water is not wet” stance appeared most often, comments that did not take a clear position were the ones that received the highest average number of likes. Figure 2 shows that neutral or humorous comments tended to draw more positive engagement than comments that argued directly for or against the question. This suggests that TikTok audiences may be more drawn to entertainment and humor than to definitional arguments. Taken together, the results show that while explicit stances leaned toward the idea that water is not wet, the broader discussion was shaped by distraction, playfulness, and a lack of consistent argumentative focus. This helps explain why both human coders and LLMs encountered a large number of comments that fell outside the main categories, and it emphasizes how public discourse on TikTok often blends joking, debate, and drifting attention."
